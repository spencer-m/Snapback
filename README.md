A SENG513 (Web-based Systems) Group Project

### Getting Started
Make sure to have Node.js installed on the computer to be used as a server for the application. A browser such as Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox with JavaScript support should be sufficient enough to run the client side of the application.

### Installing

First, download or clone the repository.
Next, the dependencies have to be satisfied. This can be done by running:

```
npm install
```
The package.json file included will tell which version for each module is required.

### Running the app

Run the server using the built-in script.
```
npm start
```
When all goes well, the server will tell it is connected to the database.
Then, open up a browser and point to the localhost address at port 3000.
```
http://localhost:3000
```
